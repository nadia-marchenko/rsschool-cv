## Summary 

Everybody has carrier aims and personal goals. I want to build high quality products that will be used by many people. I understand that my current front end knowledge leaves a lot of space for growth and I can fulfill it by this courses. I think my previous experience created the strong fundament for my success. I have more than 3+ years experience in SEO with variative activities such as updating sites and analysing them: optimization, usability and their competitors. I’m a good team player and had lead experience (teached SEO more than 20+ juniors, communicated with customers on regular basis). I'm ready to study hard and strive for excellence.
